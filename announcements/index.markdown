## **Join the COSCON Problem Writing Team!**
*July 31, 2021 at 2:19 PM*

That's right, COSCON is making a bigger and badder comeback later this fall, with more prizes, more opportunities to meet new people, and yes, more food. But we need your help! Judging from the feedback we received last year, some of the problems were too difficult and a little inaccessible, so we are opening up problem writing this year to anyone with an idea! If you're interested, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/ZjzKZds7mxNYSCSQ9" target="_blank">this form</a>. Filling out the form doesn't oblige you to write a problem, so fill it out even if you're slightly interested!

Last year's problems can be found <a href="https://coscon.princeton.edu/problems" target="_blank">here</a>. The best problems will 1) have some technical COS aspect, 2) be reasonable for a competition that lasts no more than 8 hours, and 3) have a compelling motivation. We encourage anyone interested to give problem writing a shot, even if you don't have a concrete idea. We're here to help if you need -- if you want a partner to brainstorm/discuss your ideas with, feel free to reach out to Nalin (nranjan@). 

Let your creative juices flow! Problems do not have to be Leetcode/competitive programming style questions (or even involve coding at all). In fact, the more unique and interdisciplinary, the better! And since one of our goals for COSCON this year is to make the problems more accessible, don't feel obligated to think of hard problems. 

If you fill out the form above, we'll be in touch to talk about your ideas. We're excited to see what you come up with!
