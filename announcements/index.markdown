## **Announcing ACM's First Code@Night Chill of the Year!**
*September 25, 2021 at 11:56 AM*

**TL;DR:** Join us in the **Butler iSpace at 9:30 PM Eastern on Thursday, September 30** to work on projects, socialize, play games, get advice, and/or do competitive programming practice. **FREE PIZZA PROVIDED, RSVP <a href="https://forms.gle/8MJFN5B3WUbpi28V6" target="_blank">HERE</a>**

We'll be hosting a chill event where you can **bring a project**, **meet the board**, ask questions, **socialize with others**, hate on COS 217 together, play some **games**, and eat **FREE PIZZA** all night! We will also have some practice **competitive programming** problems for those interested, as well as **office hours from our awesome career mentors**! (You won't have to hear Nalin ramble about Python, and hopefully the food will be on time this time around...) We want this to be a space where you can both be productive and blow off steam, and hopefully make some new friends :) Come one, come all — sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/8MJFN5B3WUbpi28V6" target="_blank">here</a>!

This year we are reintroducing the ACM Coffee Chat as a new way to meet fellow members. They will take place between September 8th and 15th. In the medieval times (i.e. the past few years), they were known to be virtual and had ~no~ actual coffee, but this year we're changing that... because we are looking to match people with similar interests in ACM for a chat over free coffee/boba! (No, this isn't a dating service.) Thanks to USG Projects Board for sponsoring the drinks!

**Update (September 3, 11:50 PM):** Our slots for free drinks filled up, but you can still be matched to meet another ACM member!  
**Update (September 9, 4:48 PM):** Coffee Chat assignments and free drink info should be out — let us know if you signed up but didn't get an email.

## **Our Gear Request Form is now Live!**
*September 1, 2021 at 10:45 PM*

Congrats to the Alison Lee '24 and Liam Esparraguera '24 for submitting the winning t-shirt and hoodie designs, respectively! Check them out below:
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="/images/announcements/winning_tshirt.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="/images/announcements/winning_hoodie.png">
    </div>
</div>
If it isn't clear, the back of the hoodie design is a code for an "orange-black tree," which is a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree" target="_blank">Red-Black Search Tree</a>, which was invented by Leonidas Guibas and Princeton's own Bob Sedgewick.

The <a href="https://forms.gle/RpBLyi5Xfa4ZpMNcA" target="_blank">gear request form</a> is now live. T-shirts are $6 with a subsidy and $12 without; hoodies are $15 with a subsidy and $25 without. **We can only subsidize a limited amount, so order ASAP to maximize your chance at claiming subsidized gear!** More info and rules about who gets priority for a subsidy are in the Google Form.

**Update (September 7, 12:00 PM):** The gear order period has ended. We might have extras left over though, so let us know if you're still interested!

## **Mental Health Project Looking for NLP Interns!**
*August 27, 2021 at 12:01 PM*

Through its media and technology products, Impact Media 360 powers social impact by driving awareness, attitude change and action. Motivated by success of The Real Deal reality TV series, the company is expanding into mental health tech. 

The product being built is a platform that enables an individual to crowd source a positive sense of self for themselves or a loved one. With suicide, depression and anxiety on the rise, this product aims to socialize the well-being industry and disrupt digital models of self validation or self-esteem.

The leadership of Impact Media 360 are looking to work with students interested in social impact, who have proficiency in NLP and are willing to complete the development of a working demonstration or prototype of the product. 

The project may relate to course work or be integral to junior papers or senior theses. The leadership will work closely with the students to ensure the prototype is built according to the vision and completed within a four month time frame. Opportunities to join the organization in a full time or part time capacity are available.

For more information, contact Shikha Uberoi Bajpai '13 founder and president of Impact Media 360 at [shikha@shikhauberoi.com](shikha@shikhauberoi.com).

## **Join the COSCON Problem Writing Team!**
*July 31, 2021 at 2:19 PM*

<img src="/images/COSCON_white_background_nomargins.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; padding-bottom: 30px; width: 60%">

That's right, COSCON is making a bigger and badder comeback later this fall, with more prizes, more opportunities to meet new people, and yes, more food. But we need your help! Judging from the feedback we received last year, some of the problems were too difficult and a little inaccessible, so we are opening up problem writing this year to anyone with an idea! If you're interested, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/ZjzKZds7mxNYSCSQ9" target="_blank">this form</a>. Filling out the form doesn't oblige you to write a problem, so fill it out even if you're slightly interested!

Last year's problems can be found <a href="https://coscon.princeton.edu/problems" target="_blank">here</a>. The best problems will 1) have some technical COS aspect, 2) be reasonable for a competition that lasts no more than 8 hours, and 3) have a compelling motivation. We encourage anyone interested to give problem writing a shot, even if you don't have a concrete idea. We're here to help if you need -- if you want a partner to brainstorm/discuss your ideas with, feel free to reach out to Nalin (nranjan@). 

Let your creative juices flow! Problems do not have to be Leetcode/competitive programming style questions (or even involve coding at all). In fact, the more unique and interdisciplinary, the better! And since one of our goals for COSCON this year is to make the problems more accessible, don't feel obligated to think of hard problems. 

If you fill out the form above, we'll be in touch to talk about your ideas. We're excited to see what you come up with!
