The Princeton ACM is the student chapter of the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://acm.org). The Princeton ACM aims to connect and create a community for Princeton students of all majors interested in computer science. We hold regular events, such as our bi-to-tri-weekly all-night-long Hackathons ("Code@Night"), study breaks, and programming competitions. We also hold a variety of career events, such as a Resume Workshop (sponsored by Facebook) or mock technical interviews.

Check us out by coming to one of our events!

We send out periodic notifications to all ACM members to inform them of upcoming events, job opportunities, and other things we feel you guys should know. To sign up, visit the link to our Listserv in the top menu bar.
