The Princeton ACM is the student chapter of the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://acm.org).

The Princeton ACM aims to connect and create a community for Princeton students of all majors interested in computer science. We hold regular events, such as Code@Nights, programming competitions, and coffee chats. We also hold a variety of career events, such as resume workshops or mock technical interviews.

We send out periodic notifications to all ACM members to inform them of upcoming events, job opportunities, and other useful information. If you would like to receive these emails, please [subscribe to our email list!](http://eepurl.com/c3FpVf)

For detailed information about how ACM is run, take a look at our [constitution](/about/constitution/). If you would like to contact us, you can do so [here](/contact/index.html).
