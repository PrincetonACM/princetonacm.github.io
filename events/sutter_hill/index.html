              Sutter Hill Ventures is coming to the COS Department at
              Princeton to present their Codepoint Fellowship (more
              info below), as well as present some of the work they do
              at the various companies in their portfolio. The
              fellowship has two tracks: one for students passionate
              about frontend/fullstack engineering and web
              development, and another for students interested in
              backend, low-level systems programming. Youâ€™re eligible
              for the fellowship this year if you are graduating in
              2024/2025, but the session is open to anyone who might
              be interested in working with SHV in the future.
              <br/><br/>

	      Join us on <strong>Monday, September 16, 2024 from
		5-6 PM in CS 105</strong>. Free food/boba will be
	      provided! This information session composed of a talk,
	      followed by a demo led by one of their former
	      Codepoint Fellows and Q&A at the end of the session.

                            Ventures (SHV)</a> is the oldest venture
                            capital firm in Silicon Valley. Founded in
                            1962, SHV has invested in and built

                            and Snowflake Computing. Their approach
                            centers on working with great technical
                            founders to solve some of the most
                            challenging problems in science and
                            engineering. In the last decade, they have
                            created sixteen companies worth over $100

	    <h2>What is the Codepoint Fellowship?</h2>
	    The Codepoint Fellowship is a highly competitive
            fellowship program that gives exceptional computer science
            graduates the opportunity to rotate through two of seven
            portfolio companies
            (<a href="https://www.observeinc.com/">Observe</a>, <a href="https://www.sigmacomputing.com/">Sigma</a>, <a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/">Augment</a>,
            their internal team, and three in stealth) over the course
            of one year. In addition to receiving valuable technical
            training and mentorship from world-class engineers,
            fellows also receive equity in pre-IPO startups, close
            mentorship from SHV leadership, and access to professional
            development events and social activities with industry
            leaders and entrepreneurs as part of a close-knit cohort
            of talented early-career engineers.
            <br><br> The fellowship has two tracks: one for students
            passionate in frontend/fullstack engineering and web
            development, and another for backend, low-level systems
