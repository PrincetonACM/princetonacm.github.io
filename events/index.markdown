Here are a list of the events that ACM organizes:

### Code@Night
Code@Night (C@N) is a bi-to-tri-weekly all-night-long hacking session to let students that like to code come together and work on fun projects, eat pizza and pop tarts, and geek out.

### Teddy Bear Programming
Teddy Bear Programming is when two people, a main programmer and a secondary programmer, sit together and work on a project that the main programmer has. The main programmer does most of the programming and explains what they're doing, while the secondary programmer asks questions and provides helpful feedback.

### Coffee Chats
Coffee chats are a way to meet your fellow CS students, find out what classes/professors you should take, and get free coffee, hot chocolate, or some other drink. They are usually held at the beginning of each semester.
