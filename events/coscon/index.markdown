The ACM programming team is a group of students that practice for and compete in fun algorithmic programming contests. The competition chair usually organizes a weekly meeting for the team to practice for upcoming competitions.

We typically perform very well. Recent placings at the ACM Regional CollegiateÂ Programming Contest (Greater NY Region):

*   2013: 2nd place, plus top underclassman team
*   2010: 1st and 2nd place, plus top underclassman team
*   2007: 2nd and 3rd place
*   2005: 2nd place

Anyone is welcome to join (freshman to grad students). No prior experience necessary! If you have done USACO or other competitions, that's great too!

Please [contact us](/contact/index.html) if you want to participate.

We recommend Individual Practice in online competitions such as:
