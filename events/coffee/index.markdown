<p>"Coffee chats are a way to meet your fellow CS students.<br />
They're a way to find out what classes are swell, and what classes will give you warm bubbly feelings.<br />
Coffee chats are a great way to get free coffee. Or hot chocolate. Or some other drink.<br />
They're a way to see what professors are really really good, and which ones tend to run naptime sessions instead of lectures."</p>
<p>ACM likes to hold coffee chats each semester, a few days before course selection. You get together with a group, a mix of veteran upperclassmen and fresh underlings, at a local cafe to share wisdom, sip coffee, and head back home with the warm fuzzy feeling of hanging out with the Princeton CS community.</p>
<p>In 2013-2014, we held coffee chats at Starbucks and Small World Coffee.</p>
