            <div id="event-details">
                A kernel pwn refers to exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code. These attacks are powerful because the kernel controls core system functions, meaning a successful exploit can bypass security boundaries and compromise the entire machine. This presentation will deep dive into the subject with post-mortem analysis.

            <div id="event-details">
                What is information, and why does it make secrets possible? Join p l a i n t e x t this week for an approachable introduction to information theory: the mathematical lens that treats information as a fundamentally measurable and universal currency. We'll use information-theoretic concepts such as entropy and mutual information to understand what makes an encryption protocol genuinely secure as opposed to merely persuasive. Come with your curiosity, and stay for the ideas (and boba): secrecy looks different when it can be measured.

Each person that gets a part won't learn the secret but if enough of them combine their individual parts, they can recover the secret! Super cool! This is actually used in practice for missile and nuclear launch codes to keep them secure from misuse! Come learn how it all works at p l a i n t e x t this week!

            <div id="event-details">
                Quantum computing and quantum technology are poised to take the world by storm in the coming decades. Learn more about the fundamentals behind quantum cryptography as we delve into qubits, quantum entanglement, and the famous BB84 protocol -- a cryptographic protocol where the security guarantees come from the laws of physics!

            <div id="event-title"> 09/17/24: AES-ECB and Padding Oracle Attacks</div>
            <div id="event-details">
                The block cipher AES has withstood cryptanalytic attacks for ages, and is being used everywhere right now! However, like all block ciphers, AES requires a "mode of operation" to work properly. This is where things go wrong... At <span class="first-char">p</span>laintext this week, you'll learn about AES, the ECB mode of operation, the PKCS#1 scheme, and the ECB padding oracle attack!

            <div id="event-details">
                We can attack RSA, the most important encryption system in the world, using linear algebra! This technique is called Coppersmith's method and is incredibly versatile.
                Come to the inaugural <span class="first-char">p</span>laintext meeting for an introduction to RSA, followed by a deep dive into lattices, the LLL algorithm, modular polynomials, Estonian ID cards, and more!
