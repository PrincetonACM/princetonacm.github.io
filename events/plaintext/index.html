                With secret sharing, you can split a secret into multiple parts and share them with other people. Each person that gets a part won't learn the secret but if enough of them combine their individual parts, they can recover the secret! Super cool! This is actually used in practice for missile and nuclear launch codes to keep them secure from misuse! Come learn how it all works at p l a i n t e x t this week!

                Would it be possible to devise an encryption scheme such that adding two ciphertexts would correspond to an encryption of the addition of both the plaintexts? Or does this necessarily compromise on security?
