### [We're still in the process of planning how course advising this semester will go, but stay tuned for details. Feel free to [contact us](/contact) if you have any suggestions too. Thanks for your patience!]

As a wise woman once said,

*"Coffee chats are a way to meet your fellow CS students. They're a way to find out what classes are swell, and what classes will give you warm bubbly feelings. Coffee chats are a great way to get free coffee. Or hot chocolate. Or some other drink. They're a way to see what professors are really really good, and which ones tend to run naptime sessions instead of lectures."*

ACM likes to hold coffee chats — usually at Small World or Starbucks — each semester, a few days before course selection. You get together with a group, a mix of veteran upperclassmen and fresh underlings, at a local cafe to share wisdom, sip coffee, and head back home with the warm fuzzy feeling of hanging out with the Princeton CS community.
