      <h2>About ACM</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome new workshop chairs! We're really excited to have you with us at ACM, and this will be a brief document to outline the organization of the club and our workshop program.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, note that we're one of the groups changing the COS experience here at Princeton. Our events help bring together students, promote research in certain areas, and bring awareness to everything from projects to career paths! As an ACM officer, you'll be able to meet more people on campus and help shape the CS experience at Princeton. ACM also forms a robust network between schools and is recognized outside of Princeton (in fact, it's the largest and most well-known CS society). We're also excited to work with other groups on campus to make events happen (such as COS Council, PCA, the Career Center, Hoagie, etc.)!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Meetings -->
    <section id="meetings">
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>When:</strong> We'll have meetings every other week at 5:45pm on Wednesdays, starting with next week (2/26).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where:</strong> Frist Class of 1952 Room, which is in the late meal area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 45 minutes (although the first meeting might be slightly longer). Beyond that, we might have additional meetings for large events (such as COSCON) or have smaller group meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the meetings, we'll discuss the progress of events and any issues that we are facing. To keep the meetings short, each team will write out the changes they've made, issues they are facing, and things left to be done for their events on a shared meeting doc, which we will review before the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="button" href="" target="_blank">ACM Meeting Notes Spring 2025</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>First Meeting:</strong> Wednesday 2/26, 5:45pm at the Frist Class of 1952 Room.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Communication -->
    <section id="communication">
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        We generally use discord for communication, you can join the ACM Discord here:
        <a href="" target="_blank">ACM Discord</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you have notifications on! When you join the discord, change your server nickname to your real name. Feel free to introduce yourself in the #general channel as a new workshop officer!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you want to contact ACM officers, the easiest way to do so is on discord/in the appropriate channel or over email.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Google Drive -->
    <section id="google-drive">
      <h2>Google Drive</h2>
      <p>
        All ACM documents are stored in a shared Google Drive (including this document). The only exception is for forms with file upload, as Google Drive won't let us store those in a shared drive, so you'll have to ask for access to any of those.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be adding you in the next week or so to the drive.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Projects & Initiatives -->
    <section id="projects">
      <h2>Projects & Initiatives</h2>
      <p>
        Here are the projects and partners we have in mind for all of you! We anticipate the projects largely being driven by the new officers, with the experienced officers providing support along the way.

    <section id="contacts">
      <h2>Key Contacts</h2>
      <p>
        You can check out of all our officers on our <a href="https://princetonacm.github.io/about/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> and fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRiUQXYj_B0vbW4XXGocEWQNqyGmWei6JBV7ohfFxbfGiC4w/" target="_blank">form here</a> so we can add you as an officer on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some officers you'll interact frequently with are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>President/Chair:</strong> Devan Shah<br>
        You can go to me for any questions you have, any ideas you'd like to try, or for any advice. I generally try to help out as best I can in any way you would like for your event!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Treasurer:</strong> Alexa Wingate (awingate@princeton.edu)<br>
        You can ask Alexa for any budgeting questions or questions on payment/purchases. For instance, "How much can I spend on boba for this event", "How should I purchase boba with ACM paying," "How can I get reimbursed for this purchase for my event," etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Outreach:</strong> Kia Ghods<br>
        You can ask Kia any questions about sharing forms/information using the ACM email server, from Hoagie, or to any of the CS student listservs. Generally, you'll ask Kia to include your event description in an ACM email sent out 2 weeks and 1 week before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Chair:</strong> Daniel Yang<br>
        Daniel can help with all things technical and relating to our website. For instance, if you'd like to put your event on our website, add it to our google calendar, or if you'd like to create technical materials relating to your event (i.e., a custom game or workshop materials), you can ask Daniel to help!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Event Types -->
    <section id="events">
      <h2>Event Types</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some event ideas we've hosted in the past:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Study Breaks:</strong> We'll host ACM study breaks with trivia questions, snacks and/or boba, and prizes!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research and Graduate School:</strong> August will host a talk discussing whether graduate school is right for students and the benefits of undergraduate research even if students do not plan to attend graduate school. This event was a large success last year, and we'd likely run it similarly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Graduate Student Panel:</strong> A set of graduate students in ECE and COS (likely including August and Freddy) will talk about their experience, answer questions about why they chose graduate school, and answer audience questions!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dinner with Graduate Students:</strong> We'll invite undergraduates for a paid meal with ACM's graduate students to ask questions and discuss graduate school.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research Talks:</strong> Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students can share their research with a large audience or introduce an audience to their field (ex. David Yan volunteered for Computer Vision).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Industry Talks:</strong> Interested alumni who work in industry or company representatives (i.e., ThetaData) can speak about the work they are doing, how they started working on that project, and how students can enter the field or work on similar projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Career Oriented Event:</strong> We've previously worked with David Belson from the career center and the COS Council to host panel discussions and presentations about the interview process. Some topics to discuss include what to do as a freshman or sophomore who hasn't secured an internship or how to prepare for the FAANG/Quant cycle next year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest Groups:</strong> We currently support a few weekly subgroups, such as Princeton Competitive Programming (led by Prof. Paredes) and Plaintext (led by Raheem Idowu), which host weekly events for students interested in competitive programming or cryptography. This semester, we may also support an undergraduate NLP reading group (led by Brandon Cho) and potentially an undergraduate CV reading group (led by David Yan), if funds and interest permit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lab Visits:</strong> We'll host small sessions with grad students in their lab where undergraduates can see what a day (hour) in the life of a graduate student looks like!
        </li>
      </ul>
