<p>Hello Princeton ACM,</p>
<p>My name is Marshall Louis Reaves (PhD '13), and I am a Consultant with CKM Advisors. CKM is a consulting firm headquartered in New York City that serves clients throughout the United States and around the world. We operate at the forefront of the development and application of analytics and create pioneering methods for strategy development and performance improvement. Our teams are comprised of highly talented individuals with deep expertise in data science and consulting. We are actively recruiting technically talented students to join our team as Consultants or Data Scientists, so I wanted to reach out to ACM because we believe that your members would be an excellent fit.</p>
<p>We are looking for top students with an interest in business and a passion for learning and developing new quantitative techniques to join us as Data Scientists. Students with a passion for analyzing complex business issues and developing recommendations based on rigorous analysis of large and complex data sets typically join our team as Consultants. We hire undergraduates, Masters students, and PhD candidates from a diverse array of academic backgrounds and encourage anyone with an interest in business, problem solving, or complex data analysis to consider the opportunities available at CKM.</p>
<p>We will be visiting Princeton on 9/24 and will have an informational session and interview workshop to further discuss the work that Consultants and Data Scientists do at our firm.  We would appreciate it if you could pass along this information to your listserve so that anyone interested is able to attend. I'll to reach out again as that date approaches.</p>
