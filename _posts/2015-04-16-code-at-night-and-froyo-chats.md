Two things:

First, we're bucking the trend of coffee chats and instituting FROYO CHATS. Big moves, right? Come and discuss Fall 2015-2016 course selection with your friends over froyo from Sketch, courtesy of ACM. Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/princeton.edu/forms/d/1uDrc75J50Ejy5FzljU37lHorROgSlHL-vzvDQLbpj3k/viewform) with your time preferences and we'll get back to you Friday night with which time slot you're in. Upperclassmen are definitely encouraged to sign up!

Second, there will be a Code@Night with APT this Friday in Frist 302. The talk is titled "How to scale beyond a startup" and will be about, you guessed it, scaling a company's technology past the startup stage.
