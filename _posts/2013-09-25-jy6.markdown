<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Jeffrey Yan and I am an ORFE major. I am looking for a Web/App developer for my startup. I have already done a decent amount of work on it.</p>
<p>I would like to get a minimum viable product (basic app/website testing product) out before November in time for restaurant week in Princeton. I am looking for someone who is adept at javascript, html, css, php (or any other server-side language), or objective c. This app has to do with food, so if you like food and enjoy coding, you should definitely message me. The startup will be a big task, so I need someone who can devote a considerable amount of time to this. It will also be extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>If you're interested, please email me at jy6@princeton.edu. We will have a one on one meeting to discuss more specific details. Thanks!</p>
<p>Best Regards, Jeffrey Yan</p>
