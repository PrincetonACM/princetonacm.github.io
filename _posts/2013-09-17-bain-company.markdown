<p><b>Welcome back to Princeton!</b> The beginning of the year is always a busy and exciting time as you reunite with friends and start new classes. The beginning of your senior year also brings additional challenges as you start to plan for life after Princeton. As you begin this process, we would like to introduce you to <strong>Bain &amp; Company</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is Bain?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1973, Bain &amp; Company is one of the <strong>world's top strategy consulting firms</strong> helping companies solve some of today’s most complex and challenging business problems.  We make international companies more valuable by combining an analytical approach with results-driven teamwork. Headquartered in Boston, Bain employs 5,500 people in 49 offices in 31 countries around the globe and has been named Consulting Magazine’s <strong>“Best Firm to Work For”</strong> for eleven consecutive years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is the Associate Consultant job?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associate Consultant (AC) position offers Princeton grads a unique opportunity to launch their careers in a <b>fast-paced, challenging, and incredibly rewarding environment</b>. Bain ACs develop advanced business skills helping clients across a broad range of industries solve their most important issues. Simply put, we believe that Bain ACs receive the <strong>best practical business experience</strong> available, through opportunities to work with major corporate, private equity, and non-profit clients.  We are seeking students of all majors<b> </b>with exceptional records of achievement, strong interpersonal skills, and a passion for what they do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bain ACs come from a variety of different backgrounds, both personally and academically. For many ACs, their experience over the course of two or three years serves as an outstanding foundation for other opportunities that follow. Many go on to pursue careers in industry, politics and private equity. Others leave Bain to attend top business and law schools or to work at organizations such as the World Economic Forum, the New York City Department of Education, or development NGOs.</p>
