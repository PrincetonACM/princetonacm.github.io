<p>It's been a while since the last Code@Night (but there have been<br />
other awesome things like Startup Weekend or Random Hacks of<br />
Kindness).</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_yY4_-QPM">Code@Night</a> is back!</p>
<p>FRIDAY.</p>
<p>THIS FRIDAY.</p>
<p>DECEMBER ELEVENTH.</p>
<p>ON FRIDAY:<br />
