We will be having elections at our next Code@Night on **February 24th** at **8pm** in the **Studio Lab (Basement of Fine Hall)**! If you're looking to get more involved in the computer science community at Princeton, then look no further: consider joining the ACM board this year.

Check out the list of positions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/u/2/d/0B0lmaMX2XoULdU9vNWEyZE9CeGM/view?usp=sharing&mc_cid=8de7306433&mc_eid=36b14276ee). We'll be holding dropdown elections in the order that's in that document.
