We have two great events lined up for you! Join us at Frist 302, 307, and 309 from 9PM to 2AM -- there will be pizza and fruit!
 
9-10 pm: Curious about contributing to open source software? Join Open Source at Princeton to get started contributing to [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/), the world's leading open-source medical records platform, or Ubuntu, one of the most widely used Linux distributions.  

10-11 pm: Scott Draves of Two Sigma will give a talk about Beaker Notebook and help students contribute to it. Beaker is a polyglot web-based IDE allowing you to work in many languages simultaneously.  It’s targeted at research, data analysis, and visualization, but it’s open source and you can use it to do almost anything.  Program in Python, R, Javascript, Groovy, Julia, Ruby, LaTeX, and HTML – all at the same time and on the same page!

Scott Draves is a member of the Beaker Development Team and a pioneering software artist best known for creating the Electric Sheep distributed computing project. Check out his [website](http://scottdraves.com/) for more information.
