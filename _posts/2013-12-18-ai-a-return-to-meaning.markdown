<p>Dave Ferrucci, Senior Technology Associate at Bridgewater Associates and the mastermind behind IBM’s Watson (which you may have seen on Jeopardy), will be joining us Feb 5 to discuss AI.</p>
<p>Wednesday Feb 5. 6pm.<br />
McCosh 10</p>
<p>The practice of Artificial Intelligence has evolved from being predominantly <em>theory-driven</em> to being predominately <em>data-driven</em>. The best approach to building intelligent system design may be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>In this talk Dave will discuss the history of AI in terms theory-driven, data-driven systems. Dave will introduce the approach Bridgewater is taking to build an intelligent system that can dramatically improve the way in which a company models and reasons about how to manage people.</p>
