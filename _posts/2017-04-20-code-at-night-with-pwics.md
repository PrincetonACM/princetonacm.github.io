Hello there!

Princeton ACM will be co-hosting a code@night this **Friday** at the **Butler iSpace (Wu basement)** from **8pm onwards** with Princeton Women in Computer Science (PWiCS)!

Princeton ACM and PWiCS will have an information event from 8-9 PM; this is an awesome time to ask upperclassmen for course selection advice for next year and learn more about cool side projects to get involved with. Afterwards, feel free to hang out and hack! There will be free Chinese food from Hunan throughout. Please RSVP here so we know roughly how much to order: [https://www.facebook.com/events/130471480828289/](https://www.facebook.com/events/130471480828289/)
