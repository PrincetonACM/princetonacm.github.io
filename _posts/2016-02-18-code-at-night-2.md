**Code@Night 2.0**

We are restructuring Code@Night to have more of a focus on working on side projects and hanging out with other cool computer science people! If you want to relax, talk with interesting people about CS, and carve out some time to code that side project you've always been dying to work on, then please come out to our first Code@Night of the semester, which will be this **Friday the 19th** on the **third floor of Sherrerd Hall** starting at **8pm!**

Even if you are not currently working on a project, feel free to come by to check out what other people are up to! There will be workshops on how to make your first web app, and now that the FBI is trying to backdoor our phones, how to use secure email and venture into the spooky Deep Web with Tor. There will be good food and great company. [RSVP here!](https://www.facebook.com/events/222924111385051/)
