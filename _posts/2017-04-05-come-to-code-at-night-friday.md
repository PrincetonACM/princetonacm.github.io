We will be hosting an iOS workshop during the first hour and providing free Qdoba throughout. Please RSVP here so we know roughly how much to order: [https://www.facebook.com/events/1742028539421102/](https://www.facebook.com/events/1742028539421102/)

Never heard of Code@Night? ACM Code@Nights are informal gatherings of people with a shared interest in computers and programming. We hang out, participate in workshops, work on side projects, crank out assignments, and have a good time. No matter what you're working on, whether Wordnet, your COS 333 project, your thesis, or a side project - we'd love to see your face this Friday!
