Come hear about **COS grad school** at this week's Code@Night!

Anna Kornfeld Simpson '14, currently a PhD student studying computer security at University of Washington, will talk about why you might want to go to grad school, how to prepare and apply, and how grad school differs from doing independent work or thesis at Princeton. The talk will have thoughts for all class years, and there will be Q&A afterwards, so bring your questions!

As usual, it will be held in Frist 307 and 309 at 9PM until late.
