Not too much going on this week other than… CODE@NIGHT!!! This **Friday, April 8th from 8pm ‘till late in the Butler iSpace***. Come learn about version control and Github with Rohan Doshi and Andrew Ng at 10! Join us in coding, pool and Catan! Bring your homework, readings, personal projects, or come find one here. Thinking about classes for next semester? We’ll be chatting about our experiences with different courses as well.

*Getting to iSpace: Enter from the Wu-dining hall and turn left. There should be a staircase there, go downstairs and begin coding@night.
