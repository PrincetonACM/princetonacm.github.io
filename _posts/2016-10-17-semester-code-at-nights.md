Our last Code@Night of the year is coming up this **Friday, December 9th at 8pm** in the **Studio Lab (Basement of Fine Hall)**!

Swing through for an introduction to React JS. 
React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. Together with React Native, you can write powerful mobile apps. In the workshop, we will cover React design philosophy and walk through examples that feature the library's capabilities. If you want to build UIs but don't like fidgeting with HTML and jQuery, this workshop is for you!
