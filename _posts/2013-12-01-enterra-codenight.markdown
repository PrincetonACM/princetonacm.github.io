<p>We want to give a big thank you to <strong>Enterra</strong> for hosting our last C@N. It was a huge success. If you weren't there on the 22nd, you missed a fascinating presentation on ontological networks.</p>
<p>You can make up for your absence by coming to the next C@N! It's hosted by <strong>Tower Research</strong>, and it's going to be so exciting that we can't wait to see you there! In fact, we moved the date up because we couldn't wait! The next Code@Night is <strong>Friday, December 6th</strong> in <strong>Sherrerd Hall</strong> from <strong>9PM until late</strong>. Don't believe me? <a href="http://www.whenisthenextcodeatnight.com">Here's proof</a>.</p>
