<p>Code@Night's are great. They're a bonding experience. They're programming experience. And there's pizza. They really couldn't come often enough. The next one? <strong>Friday, March 1, 2013.</strong></p>
<p>You're invited! We'll be on the <strong>third floor of Sherrerd Hall</strong> starting at <strong>9pm</strong>. That's March 1, 2013. Mark your calendars.</p>
