Yay!

After a semester of being down, the Princeton ACM website is now redesigned and back up, courtesy of our awesome webmaster! We will be posting news and upcoming events on this website, in addition to emailing them out to listservs. Stay tuned for the cool stuff that's going to be happening this semester! :)
