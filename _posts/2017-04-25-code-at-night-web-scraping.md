Have you ever wondered how to scrape websites for their data? Looking for more Python practice? Good news! This Friday, Princeton ACM will be hosting a workshop on **Web Scraping**! It’ll be during our last Code@Night for the semester. Come join us **this Friday from 8pm until late in the Butler iSpace!** Oh, there’ll be Jules Pizza - RSVP here so that we know how much to order:

Never heard of Code@Night? ACM Code@Nights are informal gatherings of people with a shared interest in computers and programming. We hang out, participate in workshops, work on side projects, crank out assignments, and have a good time. No matter what you're working on, whether a programming assignment, your COS 333 project, your thesis, or a side project - we'd love to see you there!
