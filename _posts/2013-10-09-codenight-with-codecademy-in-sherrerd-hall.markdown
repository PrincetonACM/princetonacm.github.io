<p>Can a can can-can? No. That'd be ridiculous. Cans don't have legs.</p>
<p>Code a code code-code? What? That's even more ridiculous. It doesn't even make sense.</p>
<p>Code at night at Code@Night with Codecademy? Ok, now you're being reasonable.</p>
<p>Join Ryan Bubinski, CTO and Founder of Codecademy, for a Code@Night this <strong>Friday, October 11, at Sherrerd on the third floor from 9pm to late.</strong></p>
