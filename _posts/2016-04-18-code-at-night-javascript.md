We've got the last Code@Night of the year this **Friday April 22, 8pm 'till late at the Butler Innovation Space!** Come learn about JavaScript with our very own Richard Chu and Antony Toron! Join us in coding, board games, and eating yummie food, or bring your homework, readings, and personal projects to work on. Not sure what to major in? Come chat with upperclassmen to get some valuable insight. Here's the description for the JavaScript class:

Come learn the basics of JavaScript by making your own Cookie Clicker game! Youâ€™ll be following along by writing JavaScript code and a little bit of HTML, and hopefully end up with a cool game that you can show to your friends. The game will involve implementing buttons, a menu interface, an updating score, images, and more. The topics that we will cover during the class include: HTML tags, variable and function declarations, using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements, event handlers (such as handling button clicks), and anything else about the basics of JavaScript you may want to learn about.

And don't forget to RSVP on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1021936947889320)!
