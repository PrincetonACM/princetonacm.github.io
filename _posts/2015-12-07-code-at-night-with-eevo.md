**Code@Night with Eevo**

We have Eevo coming for our Code@Night this Friday in Sherrerd! They're a New York VR startup that aspires to be the Netflix for VR. How we'll Eevo and chill with goggles on remains to be seen however.

Nick Sahler will come and talk about how to scale infrastructure for 360 degree film, data streaming, and VR in general. We'll have a few headsets and my gaming PC to try out VR games as well!

Daniel Suo, GS1 will also be coming to discuss research opportunities in the computer vision group run by Professor Xiao and show off his robot, so if you're interested in independent work next semester, make sure to come on by!

**Donate your old tech swag!**

If you're like me, your tech t-shirts are multiplying like gremlins in your dresser drawers right now. Let's try and free up some space and give back to the less fortunate by donating your unwanted tech swag to local charities like Habitat for Humanity and Rescue Mission of Trenton. There's a collection box in the Tea Room on the second floor of the CS building and I'll be driving donations to the two organizations until class ends.
