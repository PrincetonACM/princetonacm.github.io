<p>Congratulations to all the students who came out to participate in the <a href="https://campus.interviewstreet.com/challenges/">InterviewStreet Collaborative Campus Challenge</a>. We took first place and won office hours with Jared Karim, one of the founders of YouTube!</p>
<p>If you're interested in joining us for the office hours, get in touch by email.</p>
<p>Princeton teams organized by ACM also took all top prizes at Google Games New York, held on April 21. Everyone who went had a great time!</p>
