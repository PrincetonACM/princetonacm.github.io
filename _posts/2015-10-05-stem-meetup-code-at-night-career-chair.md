**STEM Meetup (October 8)**

Career Services is having a meetup of tech companies at their location above the U-Store this Thursday at 5. Bloomberg, Delphix, and BNY Mellon will be speaking, and plenty of other companies will be coming as well. RSVP [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1633872633569196/), and let me know if you want to volunteer to help set up or clean up with me! 

**Code@Night (October 9)**

After you go to the tech career fair on Friday, come our second Code@Night in Frist 206 and 208. David Bieber '14 and Greg Owen '15 will be there to speak about Nest and Databricks, both of which are super exciting companies working with Spark, which is a framework for large-scale data processing. We'll also have interview prep and delicious food from Hoagie Haven. RSVP [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/435422446642616/)!

**Career Chair Application (due Friday)**

You'll mainly be expected to help out teach interview prep classes and organize one-on-one mock interviews.
