At the next Code@Night on **October 7th** from **8pm 'til late** in the **Butler iSpace (basement of Wu)**, we're learning about version control and Git! (No experience required!). This is a great way to get started on personal projects and highly recommended if you want to work with open source projects, PAVE, and/or Video Game Society!

There will be pizza + board games!
