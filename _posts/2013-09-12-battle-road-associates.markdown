<p>Our company, Battle Road Associates, LLC., is a small two-man operation started just over a year ago. We're developing a web- and mobile-based application to handle certain kinds of aggregation and processing functions for event data. To start with, we're looking for an intern or two to develop a simple iOS-based front-end to an existing REST API. That project will probably not take the entire summer, and as the project develops we're going to be adding extending the API and adding some additional server-side functionality. Depending on interest and availability, there could be additional part-time or full-time work available after the summer is over as well. We're located in Princeton, but we're looking for someone who can primarily work from home, so location over the summer is not an issue, and we'll also consider someone who already has some summer plans but would be interested in working for us part-time.</p>
