<p>Welcome back to school. Classes haven't even begun, and already a Code@Night is just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Code@Night Zero: the first Code@Night of the 2013-2014 school year</strong><br />
Who's invited? You are!<br />
Where is it? Sherrerd Hall. Third Floor. Sept 13. 9pm.<br />
When? Sept 13. 9pm. (In Sherrerd, on the third floor) It'll still be going at 3am. Come when you can, leave when you must.<br />

<p>At 10pm there will be a tech talk from a Bridgewater engineer titled "GIT for Data: How we're tackling big data problems in Research."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">GIT for Data: How we're tackling big data problems in Research. <em>(A tech talk with Ken Vogel)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Bridgewater's Research department, we build models of the world that need to be frequently resimulated, analyzed and understood. Our problem differs and overlaps with traditional big data in some interesting ways. Come learn about our architecture, an immutable database lets us keep less data. Our stack includes investment logic written in Scala and Excel and stored in GIT, a distributed data engine based on Cassandra (used by Netflix), and a distributed calc engine (eventually moving to the cloud).</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="www.bwater.com">Bridgewater</a> for sponsoring the first Code@Night of the year!</p>
