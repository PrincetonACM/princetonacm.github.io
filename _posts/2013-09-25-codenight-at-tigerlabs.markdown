<p>This week's Code@Night is coming up, and it's at <strong>TigerLabs</strong>. :D</p>
<p>The address of TigerLabs isÂ 252 Nassau Street, 2nd floor, Princeton, NJ, 08542 -- it's right by Ivy Inn and Hoagie Haven.</p>
<p>Come to Code@Night at TigerLabs on September 27, from 9pm to late.</p>
<p>We'll have pizza, ping pong, and programming.</p>
<p>Perhaps this week we'll order the pizza via our pizza-ordering Python script.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll even get a totally random pizza.py!</p>
