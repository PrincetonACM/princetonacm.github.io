We're gonna be coding at night with Predata, a NYC-based startup that uses data science and machine learning to... PREDICT THE FUTURE! Their goal is to predict crises and major world events for clients using conversations on social media to determine the amount of political volatility in an area. If you've ever non-ironically said that you're "into machine learning" or that "data science is probably going to be important someday", this is the team for you. Collin Stedmann '15 will be presenting. I'll be reprising my Hack Princeton web design class where we make a really rough approximation of Rap Genius (Rap Novice). I'll also show off some Javascript transcompilers like Babel if you're not ready to hop on board the JS-is-the-only-language future we're heading towards.
