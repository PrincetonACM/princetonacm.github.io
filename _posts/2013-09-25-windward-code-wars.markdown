<p>Greetings Code Warriors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to your emails the CEO at Windward has caved to your pressure and has decided to let us run Windward Code Wars 2014!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the onus is on you to get your schools signed up. Forward this link to your CS professor or the ACM president. OK, maybe I should just say, forward this to whoever it was that signed up your school to participate last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.       Send link to CS professor ­ <a href="http://codewar.windward.net/" target="_blank">http://codewar.windward.net/</a></p>
<p>2.       Register your team ( you can change members, name, etc. later) - <a href="http://codewar.windward.net/" target="_blank">http://codewar.windward.net/</a></p>
<p>3.       Put it in your cellphone calendar that on the Saturday before Super Bowl Sunday (Feb 4), you are going show who’s code can make it to the end zone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply if you have any questions! I’ll keep you updated as to sponsors and prizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
