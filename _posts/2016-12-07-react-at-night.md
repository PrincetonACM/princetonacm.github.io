We're learning about Javascript/CSS at the next **Code@Night, Oct 21st** from **8pm 'til late** in the **Butler iSpace (basement of Wu)**. We'll also have project leads introducing their projects. This is a great way to get started using that Git knowledge!

Here are a list of dates for upcoming Code@Nights for the semester:

* Friday, October 21st
* Friday, November 18th
* Friday, December 2nd
* Friday, December 9th

Hope to see you there!
