<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Princeton ACM wants to hold a movie night for you at 10pm on Wednesday, 05/04/2011, in the CS104 (Computer Science Building).</p>
<p>But, what movie are these handsome ACM people showing us? Whatever movie you want to see! (Well...almost...try to keep it vaguely related to CS, Programming, or Engineering.)</p>
<p>VOTE HERE: <a title="http://goo.gl/Fxr5D" href="http://goo.gl/Fxr5D">http://goo.gl/Fxr5D</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
