<p>Why join Present?</p>
<p>Present is an early stage startup that allows people to discover, create, and share live video with the world.  We're creating a way for people to see whatever they want to at any time; to feel empowered to see what's happening anywhere without the obstacle of distance.  Present is building the future of media broadcasting, leveling viewers and content creators, and we'd love for you to build with us.</p>
<p>We're a Tigerlabs portfolio company.  Working with us now, you'll participate largely in product development, customer engagement, and business development – every one of us does.  You'll attend speaker series and you'll meet leaders in NYC venture capital, and the startup ecosystem.  The daily grind at this stage is best described as <i>making shit happen</i> – if that's what you're into, you'll fit right in.</p>
<p>Our office is located in Princeton, NJ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our culture</p>
<p>- Nothing is difficult.</p>
<p>- "Fun": adjective a way to describe a situation in which you have to do something you're not at all familiar with.</p>
<p>- Be adaptable… startup life comes with occasional sharp turns and call-ins.</p>
<p>- See what needs to be done, and make great moves.</p>
<p>- Make mistakes and own them – just don't miss opportunities.  (<i>Recognize, and internalize lessons from those mistakes!)</i></p>
<p>- Be curious, and question the status quo.</p>
<p>- '<i>It's impossible' </i>sounds more like '<i>I have not looked into it.'</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits &amp; perks</p>
<p>- Play a huge role as an early contributor to Presents' products.</p>
<p>- Play some <b>fierce</b> ping-pong with startups, awesome VCs, and international business leaders.</p>
<p>- Your mentors are leaders in the startup world.</p>
<p>- Contribute business, product, and technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other benefits &amp; perks</p>
<p>- Do you like dogs?  Me too!  All week there are dogs around the office</p>
<p><i>  - Don't worry they aren't in your space if you don't like them ;(</i></p>
<p>- Ripstick when your not coding.</p>
<p>- Coffee makes you smarter.  Enjoy nearby Small World Coffee.</p>
<p>- ...Yes, there is an Xbox.</p>
