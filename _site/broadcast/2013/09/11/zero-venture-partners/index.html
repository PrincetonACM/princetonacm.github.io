    <meta property="og:description" content="<p dir="ltr">Dear ACM Group,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">My name is Abeer Desai. I graduated from NYU Stern two years ago and have recently founded a company called Zero Venture Partners. One of the things we do is help startups articulate their value proposition on the internet, and establish thought leadership through activities such as blogging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I want to connect passionate students with an opportunity to make $50/blog post writing about new developments and trends in their field of study. These blog posts will be written on behalf of a startup that is innovating in this same field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a great chance for students to develop written and communication skills, add additional experience to their resume, and earn a solid side stream of money. Our program requires 1 blog post per week with each post being 600 - 900 words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We currently have 1 open opportunity for a student studying in a field (or with appropriate experience) related to cloud technology and mobile app development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in learning more I would be happy to provide additional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let me know if you would like to keep in touch about future companies we work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Best regards,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Abeer Desai</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founder, Zero Venture Partners</p>
