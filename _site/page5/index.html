            <p><p>Every Code@Night we order a solid amount of pizza. 8, 10, 12 pies. Depends on the size of the crowd.</p>
<p>Tonight, we collaboratively programmed a <a href="https://github.com/dbieber/acmpizza">pizza ordering script</a>. We hooked my computer up to the giant monitor in the CITP space in Sherrerd and made this script that would go through the whole pizza ordering process. Selenium allowed us to control the browser programmatically. Having the Selenium driven browser deal with JavaScript was difficult, so we ordered our programmatic pizza through Papa John's mobile site. There were no JavaScript issues there. The process was mostly <em>look up an xpath in chrome</em>, <em>do stuff on that element</em>, repeat. Pretty exciting to watch the script go through and order all our pizza all on its own.</p>
<p>How does programmatic pizza taste compared to your ordinary Code@Night pizza? Couldn't tell you. It's Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>As a side note to those planning future Code@Nights, these events will slow down sooner on Yom Kippur. Generally a good idea to plan around this.</p>
<p>Next steps? Have our script order a completely random pizza. Or take preferences, and order the utility-maximizing combination of pizzas. Or expand to non-Papa-Johns foods. Or... get this... we turn pizza ordering into a one-button process with a Raspberry Pi, which we would of course affectionately name our Raspberry Pizza Pie.</p>
<p>Want to actually implement some of these "next steps"? Dig into <a href="https://github.com/dbieber/acmpizza">the code on Github</a>.</p>

            <p><p>Our company, Battle Road Associates, LLC., is a small two-man operation started just over a year ago. We're developing a web- and mobile-based application to handle certain kinds of aggregation and processing functions for event data. To start with, we're looking for an intern or two to develop a simple iOS-based front-end to an existing REST API. That project will probably not take the entire summer, and as the project develops we're going to be adding extending the API and adding some additional server-side functionality. Depending on interest and availability, there could be additional part-time or full-time work available after the summer is over as well. We're located in Princeton, but we're looking for someone who can primarily work from home, so location over the summer is not an issue, and we'll also consider someone who already has some summer plans but would be interested in working for us part-time.</p>
