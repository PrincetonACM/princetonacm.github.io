            <p><p><b>Welcome back to Princeton!</b> The beginning of the year is always a busy and exciting time as you reunite with friends and start new classes. The beginning of your senior year also brings additional challenges as you start to plan for life after Princeton. As you begin this process, we would like to introduce you to <strong>Bain &amp; Company</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is Bain?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1973, Bain &amp; Company is one of the <strong>world's top strategy consulting firms</strong> helping companies solve some of today’s most complex and challenging business problems.  We make international companies more valuable by combining an analytical approach with results-driven teamwork. Headquartered in Boston, Bain employs 5,500 people in 49 offices in 31 countries around the globe and has been named Consulting Magazine’s <strong>“Best Firm to Work For”</strong> for eleven consecutive years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is the Associate Consultant job?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associate Consultant (AC) position offers Princeton grads a unique opportunity to launch their careers in a <b>fast-paced, challenging, and incredibly rewarding environment</b>. Bain ACs develop advanced business skills helping clients across a broad range of industries solve their most important issues. Simply put, we believe that Bain ACs receive the <strong>best practical business experience</strong> available, through opportunities to work with major corporate, private equity, and non-profit clients.  We are seeking students of all majors<b> </b>with exceptional records of achievement, strong interpersonal skills, and a passion for what they do.</p>

<p>Bain ACs come from a variety of different backgrounds, both personally and academically.

Many go on to pursue careers in industry, politics and private equity.

            <p><p>Every Code@Night we order a solid amount of pizza. 8, 10, 12 pies. Depends on the size of the crowd.</p>
<p>Tonight, we collaboratively programmed a <a href="https://github.com/dbieber/acmpizza">pizza ordering script</a>. We hooked my computer up to the giant monitor in the CITP space in Sherrerd and made this script that would go through the whole pizza ordering process. Selenium allowed us to control the browser programmatically. Having the Selenium driven browser deal with JavaScript was difficult, so we ordered our programmatic pizza through Papa John's mobile site. There were no JavaScript issues there. The process was mostly <em>look up an xpath in chrome</em>, <em>do stuff on that element</em>, repeat. Pretty exciting to watch the script go through and order all our pizza all on its own.</p>
<p>How does programmatic pizza taste compared to your ordinary Code@Night pizza? Couldn't tell you. It's Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>As a side note to those planning future Code@Nights, these events will slow down sooner on Yom Kippur. Generally a good idea to plan around this.</p>
<p>Next steps? Have our script order a completely random pizza. Or take preferences, and order the utility-maximizing combination of pizzas. Or expand to non-Papa-Johns foods. Or... get this... we turn pizza ordering into a one-button process with a Raspberry Pi, which we would of course affectionately name our Raspberry Pizza Pie.</p>
<p>Want to actually implement some of these "next steps"? Dig into <a href="https://github.com/dbieber/acmpizza">the code on Github</a>.</p>

            <p><p>Our company, Battle Road Associates, LLC., is a small two-man operation started just over a year ago. We're developing a web- and mobile-based application to handle certain kinds of aggregation and processing functions for event data. To start with, we're looking for an intern or two to develop a simple iOS-based front-end to an existing REST API. That project will probably not take the entire summer, and as the project develops we're going to be adding extending the API and adding some additional server-side functionality. Depending on interest and availability, there could be additional part-time or full-time work available after the summer is over as well. We're located in Princeton, but we're looking for someone who can primarily work from home, so location over the summer is not an issue, and we'll also consider someone who already has some summer plans but would be interested in working for us part-time.</p>
