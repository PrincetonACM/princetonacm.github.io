<h2 id="interview-prep-debrief--chill-qa-with-meta-engineers"><strong>Interview Prep Debrief + Chill Q&amp;A with Meta Engineers</strong></h2>
<p><em>March 16, 2022 at 11:32 PM</em></p>

<p>Thanks so much to all that came to our interview prep event with Meta! I hope you all found it helpful and insightful. A couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Princeton’s Meta recruiter has offered to share her emails with Princeton students. Reach out to <a href="mailto:ptonacm@princeton.edu" target="_blank">ptonacm@princeton.edu</a> if you’d like to contact her. If you do, please keep general email courtesy in mind.</li>
  <li>For those who couldn’t attend, we were able to take some notes of what was said. They can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjcfDrRiKY7oNfBdjTT530Bf2KjRfUjPSaWb0Ysuui0/edit" target="_blank">here</a>. Unfortunately, they refused to record the event or share their slides.</li>
  <li>As a follow-up, we’ll be having a chill Q&amp;A session with some Meta Engineers on 3/23! Come with any questions about the recruiting process, what it’s like to work at Meta, which offices are the best, the food at the Meta cafeteria, etc. Anything is fair game! <span style="color: #2D6DFF; font-size: 30px"><a href="https://forms.gle/yHbv2w4zcTrYVGxU7" target="_blank">RSVP HERE</a></span> <strong><em>Note: Even if you can’t make it, you can submit questions via the RSVP form, and we’ll try to ask them and write any answers down.</em></strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a great rest of your week, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<h2 id="acm-officer-elections-for-the-2022-2023-year"><strong>ACM Officer Elections for the 2022-2023 Year</strong></h2>
<p><em>March 9, 2022 at 2:28 PM</em></p>

<p>ACM officers have the unique opportunity to influence, lead and represent Princeton University’s computer science club — so if you enjoyed events that we held in the past two semesters or are eager to implement your own ideas to better the COS community, you should consider joining the board the next year!</p>

<p><span style="color: #f58025; font-size: 28px"><strong>Here is <a href="https://forms.gle/gdTUGVRGnGm3udTx9" target="_blank">the form</a> to declare your candidacy. The deadline to fill it out is 4/4/2022, and elections will be held on 4/7/2022 <em>in person</em>.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Candidate Eligibility.</em></strong> With the exception of the graduate liaison (who must be a grad student) and the competitions chair (who can be a grad or an undergrad), all candidates must be undergraduates graduating in 2023 or later. You also must have attended <u>at least two ACM events or have spent more than 5 hours at one ACM event</u> within the past two semesters: COSCON, ICPC, Code@Nights, Socials, and Mock Interviews all count!</p>

<p><strong><em>Voting Eligibility.</em></strong> You can vote if you’ve attended <u>at least one ACM event</u> in the past two semesters.</p>

<p><strong><em>Open Positions and Responsibilities.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Chair (President).</em></strong> Head of the club, responsible for organizing meetings/events, and charting the course for ACM. In the past, the chair has also taken a very active role in organizing COSCON, though they may choose to bring on another team to help out. Also partially responsible for developing a financial plan for the coming year.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vice-Chair (Vice President).</em></strong> Aids the chair in distributing/completing tasks and in logistical-related work.</p>

<p><strong><em>Secretary-Treasurer.</em></strong> Manage the budget and oversee fundraising. <em>This is a very important position!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Competitions Chair.</em></strong> Run ICPC (both the competition itself and practices for it) and help organize COSCON.</p>

<p><strong><em>Careers Chair.</em></strong> Manage relationships with outside companies, and work with the Workshops Chair to organize Code@Nights that further members’ career prospects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Workshops Chair.</em></strong> Coordinate workshops for Code@Nights and other events. <em>We’d love to engage more with the academia side of computer science this coming year!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Tech Chair.</em></strong> Maintain the website and aid in sending out publicity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Graduate Liaison.</em></strong> A new position that we’re including so we can better connect with our Graduate community!</p>

<p><span style="color: #f58025; font-size: 28px"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to show up in person to the elections if I’m running?</em></strong> Yes. Exceptions will only be made in extraordinary extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to show up in person to the elections if I’m just voting?</em></strong> Again, yes. Exceptions will be made more generously, though: email <a href="mailto:ptonacm@princeton.edu" target="_blank">ptonacm@princeton.edu</a> if this applies to you.</p>

<p><strong><em>How are winners decided?</em></strong> If there are only two candidates for a position, the candidate receiving a majority of the votes wins. Otherwise, there will be a primary election: if a candidate receives a majority of the votes, they win; otherwise, the top two primary finishers will be sent to a runoff.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to give a speech to run?</em></strong> Not required, but you’re more than welcome to! We highly recommend that you submit a candidate statement (50-300 words) on the application though.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is ACM’s financial situation like?</em></strong> Very good. There are plenty of funds to support whatever ideas you may have. (Of course, this doesn’t mean that the next board won’t have to fundraise.) You can contact Nalin (nranjan@) if you want to know more for some reason.</p>

<p>Are you interested in picking up a language that is used by over 6 million developers and is deployed ubiquitously in computer systems, high-frequency trading, game development, IoT devices, and more? Or have you ever wondered if COS 217, or systems programming in general, could be interesting? Then you should</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center; font-weight: strong; color: #f58025">Join us THIS FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19 at 8:00 PM in Lewis Library 138 for a Systems Intro to C++ with Andrew Wonnacott ‘19! <a href="https://forms.gle/FEzCdKi9L47qJnq9A" target="_blank">RSVP HERE</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center; font-weight: strong; color: #f58025">Food from Local Greek and Old Mission Capital swag will be provided!</span></p>

<p>Former Princeton ACM Vice President Andrew Wonnacott (currently at Old Mission Capital, ex-Hudson River Trading/DE Shaw) will introduce systems programming with C++. Andrew will demonstrate how C++ allows software engineers to build large-scale systems without the mental overhead of C-style memory management or the performance overhead of Java garbage collection. Andrew will assume familiarity with Java, but C experience is strictly not required! Afterward, we’ll have time to socialize, eat, talk about COSCON, and more, like any Code@Night!</p>

<span style="font-size:22px"><a href="https://coscon.princeton.edu" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://coscon.princeton.edu">COSCON</a> is Princeton University's Computer Science Contest! It is designed to get Princeton students of all walks excited and thinking about a variety of topics that arise in computer science.<br>
Unlike hackathons or your run-of-the-mill programming competitions, our contest won’t solely focus on the “coding” aspect of computer science: some of our problems will require the creative insight of a theoretician, while others may require the guile of a seasoned systems specialist. All you need to be able to do is think! <strong>You don't need to be a computer science major to participate or do well.</strong></span>

<p>This year we are reintroducing the ACM Coffee Chat as a new way to meet fellow members. They will take place between September 8th and 15th. In the medieval times (i.e. the past few years), they were known to be virtual and had ~no~ actual coffee, but this year we’re changing that… because we are looking to match people with similar interests in ACM for a chat over free coffee/boba! (No, this isn’t a dating service.) Thanks to USG Projects Board for sponsoring the drinks!</p>

<p><strong>Update (September 3, 11:50 PM):</strong> Our slots for free drinks filled up, but you can still be matched to meet another ACM member!<br>
<strong>Update (September 9, 4:48 PM):</strong> Coffee Chat assignments and free drink info should be out — let us know if you signed up but didn’t get an email.</p>

<p>That’s right, COSCON is making a bigger and badder comeback later this fall, with more prizes, more opportunities to meet new people, and yes, more food. But we need your help! Judging from the feedback we received last year, some of the problems were too difficult and a little inaccessible, so we are opening up problem writing this year to anyone with an idea! If you’re interested, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/ZjzKZds7mxNYSCSQ9" target="_blank">this form</a>. Filling out the form doesn’t oblige you to write a problem, so fill it out even if you’re slightly interested!</p>

<p>Last year’s problems can be found <a href="https://coscon.princeton.edu/problems" target="_blank">here</a>. The best problems will 1) have some technical COS aspect, 2) be reasonable for a competition that lasts no more than 8 hours, and 3) have a compelling motivation. We encourage anyone interested to give problem writing a shot, even if you don’t have a concrete idea. We’re here to help if you need – if you want a partner to brainstorm/discuss your ideas with, feel free to reach out to Nalin (nranjan@).</p>

<p>Let your creative juices flow! Problems do not have to be Leetcode/competitive programming style questions (or even involve coding at all). In fact, the more unique and interdisciplinary, the better! And since one of our goals for COSCON this year is to make the problems more accessible, don’t feel obligated to think of hard problems.</p>

<p>If you fill out the form above, we’ll be in touch to talk about your ideas. We’re excited to see what you come up with!</p>
