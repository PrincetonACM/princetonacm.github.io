<div><i>Why should you sign up for Mock Technical Interviews?</i></div>
<div>If you don't sign up for Mock Technical Interviews, it will be harder for you to get a job. And without a job, you wont have any money. Without money, no house. You'll be living on the streets. Where you'll probably catch malaria or be run over by a bus. Or something less morbid but equally negative in nature. Yep.</div>

<div>Sign up for Mock Technical Interviews; don't be run over by a bus! <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1amAHUBWdVEGgoiUQwDBhS6R4nmRS_xrTBeB8TSx11YE/edit#gid=1228484453" target="_blank">Sign up here.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div><i>What are the actual benefits of Mock Technical Interviews?</i></div>
<div>Technical interviews are at the heart of the job and internship search. If you're applying for a job that relates to programming, you'll have to go through a series of technical interviews. They usually involve whiteboard programming -- solving some problem by writing some code on the spot on a whiteboard -- and practicing this makes a huge difference in your performance. Yep, you get better with practice. Crazy, eh?</div>
<div><i> </i></div>
<div><i>When are these Mock Technical Interviews?</i></div>
<div><b>Various times on 2/28, 3/1, and 3/2 (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)</b></div>
<div><b>They're in various rooms in the CS Building.</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you'd rather be the interviewer rather than the interviewee, go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1amAHUBWdVEGgoiUQwDBhS6R4nmRS_xrTBeB8TSx11YE/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">the same spreadsheet</a> and add yourself to the times you'd like to interview on the sheet called "Interviewers".</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Tell us a story?</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>There once was a small but well respected fisherman in the village of Thimble. Every morning he would go off to the Finger Lakes, and that was where he would spend his day. In the evening he would come home to his family, hug his tiny children, play the lute, write some code, and then lay down his bucket full of the day's catch: hundreds of little fish. Why he did things in this order is a mystery to all.</div>
<div></div>
<div>One fateful day, our hero returned from the Finger Lakes with his greatest catch ever. One hundred forty little fish! This would feed Thimble Village for a week! (For Thimble Village was by no measure a large village.) The day after that our hero broke his fishing record once again. One hundred sixty little fish! The day after that, two hundred and eleven little fish! Thimble Village would never go hungry again! <span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: xx-small;">(He thought, not realizing this was a story about overfishing.)</span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">(The author wrote, not realizing this story would have a happy ending.)</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>Day after day, the fisherman of Thimble Village caught more and more fish. He was no longer a small fisherman now, but rather a mid-sized one, and a pleasing shape to boot. The Finger Lakes held only so many fish, and what this fisherman did not know soon would hurt him.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The fish ran out. The well respected fisherman of Thimble Village brought home the last fish from the Finger Lakes. With the only fish remaining, Thimble Village prepared fish fingers, and our hero never went fishing again. He had been overfishing, and now he was over fishing.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;">This is the bit where you get sad and resolve never ever to overfish as long as you live.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>Fortune shined upon Thimble Village that day. The people of Sew brought over an Introduced Species which quickly repopulated the Finger Lakes and was super yummy. And everyone lived happily ever after.</div>
