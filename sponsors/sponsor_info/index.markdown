Contact us [here](/contact) if any of the opportunities below are a good fit and we'll follow-up with payment details.

## <a name="coscon"></a>COSCON: Princeton's Student-Run Computer Science Contest

Barring any public health disruptions, COSCON will be held on **November 6, 2021 on Princeton's campus**. The competition will be accessible *virtually*, but we are hoping to hold in-person events for organizations and students to connect! See <a href="/sponsors/sponsor_info/docs/coscon_fall_contribution_tiers.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a> for COSCON's contribution tiers.

## <a name="code-at-night"></a>Code@Night Sponsorship

Code@Nights are usually held on a biweekly basis on Thursday/Friday evenings, but this is not a hard and fast requirement. They almost always include some time for networking between students and the host, but we ask that there be some technical or career-building presentation beforehand. Check out our Code@Night contribution tiers <a href="/sponsors/sponsor_info/docs/code-at-night_tiers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> --- we have a couple suggestions for how to make your Code@Night better in there!

## Miscellaneous

<a name="resume"></a>
- **Resume Book.** Our resume book (which contains roughly 170 resumes) can be purchased for $750. It will be delivered electronically in Mid-September (so as to give us enough time to collect them). If you'd like access to the resumes we already have earlier than that, we are open to offering you incremental versions. Note also that we will be collecting resumes in COSCON (held in November), and that these additional resumes are available for purchase for $250 extra (with the purchase of the original resume book). 

<a name="hq"></a>
- **HQ Visits.** This year, we're looking to connect more with our sponsoring organizations! You can sponsor a trip to your headquarters for an access fee of $25 per attendee or $500 dollars (whichever is lower). We will also be willing to provide up to $300 in transportation fees.

<a name="advertising"></a>
- **Advertising.** ACM is also a good place to advertise through our website and our listserv (which boasts 450+ recipients). We offer the following options:
    - Send an approved one-time message to all listserv recipients and have a corresponding announcement posted on ACM's website for $100.
    - Get listserv access and your logo posted on ACM's website for the entire school year for $500. Note that listserv access is restricted to at most 1 message per two-week period, so as to prevent spamming.

  We will waive the listserv access cost if the message sender is an academic organization or a fellow Princeton student group.

As always, [contact us](/contact) if you have any other sponsorship proposals -- we're always receptive to new ideas and are willing to negotiate.
