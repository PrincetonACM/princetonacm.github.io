  <h2>What is ACM?</h2>
  <p>ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is an organization dedicated to fostering communities of people interested in computer science and related interests.</p>
  <p>Princeton's student chapter of the ACM hosts regular mini-hackathons called Code@Nights every two or three weeks. They start with one-hour-long educational workshops, and there is free time afterwards where people stay to work on assignments and side projects, or to hang out and meet people.</p>
  <p>We also send multiple teams to ICPC, the International Collegiate Programming Contest.</p>
