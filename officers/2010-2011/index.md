### Chair: Jen King

Jen adores making long "to do" lists and convincing people to help her check things off.  Next on her list is persuading you to come to all of our ACM events, and then locating Hermione's time-turner to fit even more activities into a day.

### Vice Chair: Emily Lancaster

Emily is a computer science major.  She studies computer science because she recognizes how the world is dependent on technology and wants to learn more about software and computers so she can exploit them.  Upon graduation, Emily plans to become a super villain and take over the world.  She wants you to be a CS major too so you can join her.

### Secretary/Treasurer: Patrick Wendell

Patrick was a late round draft pick for the Princeton ACM's senior leadership. He is widely recognizes as being the only ACM officer who owns a car.

### Competitions Chair: Jarett Schwartz

Jarett really wants you to join the ACM, the Programming Team, and the COS department. Seriously.
