The 2018-2019 Princeton ACM Student Chapter is run by these fools:

**Chair:** Theodore Ando
Theodore Ando ('20) is a Canada-born, California-made Chicagoan studying COS. Ask him anything about algorithm design or natural language processing. Outside of ACM, which was the first club he joined at Princeton, he plays table tennis alongside Pton Olympians, watches Netflix Marvel shows, and enjoys excessively using his Nespresso machine (he’s always looking for tips to improve his amateur latte art). He loves hearing ideas to make ACM more fun, accessible, and inclusive--so stop by Code@Night to make a suggestion, have a chat, or just to say hi!

**Vice Chair:** Andrew Wonnacott
Andrew Wonnacott ‘19 is a junior in the computer science major with a love of all computer science, from systems to theory. You can find him as a course assistant in your theory classes and responding to Piazza at unusual hours. He also loves bicycling and public transportation, and plans to develop software systems for electronic trading in New York, combining all of these interests. Fun fact: Andrew met Maryam at the first Code@Night their freshman fall!

A computer science major who sometimes pretends to be a history major, Nathan Mytelka ‘19 particularly appreciates how easily computer science applies to any circumstance, regularly applying algorithms gleaned in one context to another, completely different challenge. He has spent rather a lot of time at the gym this semester, reading Tolstoy while riding a stationary bike, but he always makes time during the summer to play board games and go hiking.

**Careers:** Lilly Meng
Lilly Meng ’20 is a computer science major interested in using technology to create meaningful user impact. In addition to ACM, she works with PAVE and Princeton Puzzle Hunt on campus. If she’s not on YouTube, she’s probably rambling about Broadway, looking for an open ping pong table, or napping. She hopes to plan events that will help make career navigation less stressful, so please drop a line with any suggestions!

**Communications:** Frankie Lam
Frankie Lam (’21) is a freshman from Hong Kong who can’t make up his mind between Computer Science BSE and Physics AB. He particularly enjoys algorithms and has been participating in competitive programming since high school. In his free time, he enjoys playing the piano, walking / running, and sleeping. In the future, he hopes to take part in developing AI and quantum computers.
