**Chair:** Lilly Meng ’20

Lilly Meng ’20 is a computer science major interested in using technology to create meaningful user impact. In addition to ACM, she works with Princeton Puzzle Hunt on campus. If she’s not on YouTube, she’s probably rambling about Broadway, looking for an open ping pong table, or napping. She hopes to plan events that will foster inclusivity, community, and opportunity, so please always feel free to drop a line with any suggestions!

**Vice Chair:** Frankie Lam ’21

Frankie Lam ’21 is a sophomore from Hong Kong who can’t make up his mind between Computer Science BSE and Physics AB. He particularly enjoys algorithms and has been participating in competitive programming since high school. In his free time, he enjoys playing the piano, walking / running, and sleeping. In the future, he hopes to take part in developing AI and quantum computers.

I’m a math-loving ORFE major from ATL. On campus, I am a dancer, dabbler in coding projects, and research assistant in the philosophy department. Always up for meeting new people and grabbing food, so hmu if you have any questions, suggestions, or event proposals for ACM!

**Communications:** Theodore Ando ’20
<img src="/images/2019-2020/theodoreando.jpg">
Theodore Ando ’20 is a Canada-born, California-made Chicagoan studying COS. Ask him anything about algorithm design or natural language processing. Outside of ACM, which was the first club he joined at Princeton, he plays table tennis alongside Pton Olympians, watches Netflix Marvel shows, and enjoys excessively using his Nespresso machine (he’s always looking for tips to improve his amateur latte art). He loves hearing ideas to make ACM more fun, accessible, and inclusive--so stop by Code@Night to make a suggestion, have a chat, or just to say hi!
