The 2016-2017 Princeton ACM Student Chapter is run by these swiggity-swaggity people:

**President:** Katherine Lee  
Very happy individual!

**Vice President:** Rohan Doshi  
Founder of JusText. Incoming Microsoft Software Intern. TigerTrek 2015 alum. Machine Learning Researcher & Enthusiast [github.com/RohanDoshi2018](http://github.com/RohanDoshi2018). Dancer for Princeton Bhangra (competitive South Asian dance team). You will often find me at the local hackathon working on my latest side project.

**Secretary/Treasurer:** Hector Solis  
Hector Solis '19 is from Manassas, Virginia. He is currently studying Computer Science and is interested in startups and entrepreneurship. In his free time, Hector likes to do long distance runs for fun. He is proud to be Secretary/Treasurer of ACM for this term and hopes to make the Princeton ACM chapter feel more like a tight-knit community.

**Webmaster:** Richard Chu  
Richard is a sophomore studying computer science, and he loves to build side projects and learn new things. He was previously a hackNY Fellow '15 and an intern at BuzzFeed. He is the lead developer and designer for RU Direct, which is an Android app that helps Rutgers University students navigate their bus system. In the future, he is looking to pursue work in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and perhaps help bring about the first superintelligent AI.

**Career Chair:** Antony Toron  
Hello everyone! I am a freshman and prospective computer science major, here at Princeton.  My first exposure to coding came early in my high school career, with Arduinos, where I started to become interested with the concept of being able to communicate with and manipulate technology to perform specific functions.  Now, I have been extremely interested in computer science ever since coming to Princeton and being exposed to all of the possibilities within the field. Though I like to have many extracurricular activities like hockey, tennis, and art, I have a particular affinity for computer science, which is what drew me to becoming a bigger part of ACM. Within computer science, I am very interested in developing projects that interact directly with users and have real world applications. As a result, writing code in Android Studio is a hobby of mine, along with branching out to learn new  languages not discussed within regular coursework. I hope that in the future, my excitement with computer science can translate to other people and contribute to a tight-knit computer science community on campus.
