<p>The ACM programming team is a group of students that practice for and compete in fun algorithmic programming contests. The competition chair usually organizes a weekly meeting for the team to practice for upcoming competitions.</p>
<p>We typically perform very well. Recent placings at the ACM Regional CollegiateÂ Programming Contest (Greater NY Region):</p>
<ul>
<li>2013: 2nd place, plus top underclassman team</li>
<li>2010: 1st and 2nd place, plus top underclassman team</li>
<li>2007: 2nd and 3rd place</li>
<li>2005: 2nd place</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone is welcome to join (freshman to grad students). No prior experience necessary! If you have done USACO or other competitions, that's great too!</p>
<p>Please contact us (<a href="ptonacm@princeton.edu">ptonacm@princeton.edu</a>) if you want to participate.</p>
